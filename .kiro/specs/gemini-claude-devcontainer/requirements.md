# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a devcontainer environment that includes both Gemini CLI and Claude Code tools, enabling developers to work with both AI assistants seamlessly within a containerized development environment. The devcontainer will provide a consistent, reproducible development setup with pre-configured access to both AI services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use both Gemini CLI and Claude Code within a devcontainer environment, so that I can leverage both AI assistants without manual setup on my local machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the devcontainer is built THEN it SHALL include the Gemini CLI tool properly installed and configured
2. WHEN the devcontainer is built THEN it SHALL include Claude Code (claude-dev) extension or CLI properly installed and configured
3. WHEN a developer opens the project in VS Code with Dev Containers extension THEN the container SHALL start successfully with both tools available
4. WHEN the devcontainer starts THEN both Gemini CLI and Claude Code SHALL be accessible from the terminal

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the devcontainer to handle authentication and configuration for both AI services, so that I can start using them immediately without additional setup steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the devcontainer starts THEN it SHALL provide clear instructions for API key configuration
2. WHEN API keys are provided through environment variables THEN both services SHALL authenticate successfully
3. WHEN the devcontainer is rebuilt THEN authentication configuration SHALL persist appropriately
4. IF API keys are not provided THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with setup instructions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the devcontainer to include necessary development tools and dependencies, so that I can work effectively with both AI assistants in a complete development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the devcontainer is built THEN it SHALL include Python with pip for package management
2. WHEN the devcontainer is built THEN it SHALL include Node.js and npm for JavaScript/TypeScript development
3. WHEN the devcontainer is built THEN it SHALL include Git for version control
4. WHEN the devcontainer is built THEN it SHALL include common development utilities (curl, wget, etc.)
5. WHEN the devcontainer starts THEN all installed tools SHALL be available in the PATH

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the devcontainer configuration to be easily customizable, so that I can adapt it to my specific project needs while maintaining the AI assistant functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the devcontainer configuration is provided THEN it SHALL use a modular structure that allows easy customization
2. WHEN additional VS Code extensions are needed THEN they SHALL be easily addable to the configuration
3. WHEN additional system packages are needed THEN they SHALL be easily addable to the Dockerfile
4. WHEN the configuration is modified THEN the rebuild process SHALL be efficient and not require full reinstallation of AI tools

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on how to use both AI assistants within the devcontainer, so that I can quickly understand the available commands and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the devcontainer is created THEN it SHALL include a README with setup instructions
2. WHEN the devcontainer is created THEN it SHALL include examples of common Gemini CLI commands
3. WHEN the devcontainer is created THEN it SHALL include examples of Claude Code usage
4. WHEN the devcontainer is created THEN it SHALL include troubleshooting guidance for common issues
5. WHEN the documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include information about API key management and security best practices
