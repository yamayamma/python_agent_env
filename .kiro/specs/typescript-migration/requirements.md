# Requirements Document

## Introduction

現在のPython開発環境（python_agent_env）をTypeScript開発環境に移行する。既存のPythonコードの機能を保持しながら、TypeScript/Node.jsエコシステムに適した開発環境を構築する。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Python to TypeScript development environment, so that I can leverage TypeScript's type safety and Node.js ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have a complete TypeScript project structure with package.json, tsconfig.json, and appropriate directory structure
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use npm or yarn for dependency management instead of uv
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have TypeScript compilation configured with appropriate compiler options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain code quality tools, so that I can ensure consistent code formatting and linting in TypeScript.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have ESLint configured for TypeScript linting
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have Prettier configured for code formatting
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have pre-commit hooks configured for TypeScript projects
4. WHEN linting is run THEN the system SHALL check TypeScript files for code quality issues
5. WHEN formatting is run THEN the system SHALL format TypeScript files consistently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve existing functionality, so that the migrated TypeScript code provides the same features as the original Python code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have equivalent TypeScript implementations of all Python modules (greet.py, main.py, types.py)
2. WHEN the CLI command is executed THEN the system SHALL provide the same greeting functionality as the original Python version
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same project structure organization principles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a proper testing setup, so that I can write and run tests for TypeScript code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have Jest or Vitest configured for testing TypeScript code
2. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute all test files and provide coverage reports
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have equivalent test cases migrated from Python pytest tests

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have proper build and development scripts, so that I can efficiently develop and build TypeScript applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have npm scripts for common development tasks (build, test, lint, format)
2. WHEN the build script is run THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript to JavaScript
3. WHEN the development script is run THEN the system SHALL provide hot-reload or watch mode for development
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have a CLI entry point equivalent to the Python version

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up Python-specific files, so that the repository only contains TypeScript-related configuration and code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove Python-specific files (pyproject.toml, Python source files, Python cache directories)
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove Python-specific configuration (.pre-commit-config.yaml for Python tools)
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL update .gitignore to exclude TypeScript/Node.js specific files instead of Python files
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL update README.md with TypeScript-specific instructions
